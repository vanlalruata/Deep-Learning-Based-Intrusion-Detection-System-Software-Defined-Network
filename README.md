We went on to analyze the model's accuracy, recall, and f-measure to a greater extent. The DNN algorithm was tested using the given test data.

The results of running the model with each learning rate. Since the learning rate of 0.001 provides us the best outcomes in all assessment criteria, we can conclude that it is an optimal value. As we reduce the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.001, all evaluation measures are increasing in popularity. However, as we reduce the learning rate to 0.0001, all evaluation measures abruptly decline in use. Loss and accuracy measures show that when the learning rate is dropped, the performance of the NIDS model suffers.
